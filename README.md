# seamless_micro_patterns
A library of seamless micro patterns source files made with Blender, for use in Blender 2.8 Eevee viewport or any real-time engine. Such as Unity and Unreal, but further testing is needed at this moment but I plan on making models and materials comparison between Blender 2.8 and Unreal 4.XX when Blender 2.8 is more finalized.
